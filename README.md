## What is the Cotton Data Model?
The cotton data model is an open-source data model used in personal data clouds, in the Prifina platform. This data model can be viewed diagrammatically in [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/zfQymerDoTDi31xpjQsEu3/Cotton-Data-Model), and programmatically in [Github](https://github.com/libertyequalitydata/cotton-data-model)(with the .graphql file).
### Why Cotton?
A cotton boll looks like a mini cloud that can represent the personal data clouds of the user. If a boll is inspected under a microscope, the cotton boll appears to consist of many interweaving fibers that can represent a network within the personal data cloud. This cloud data model can be visualized in the same way, i.e. zoomed out the cloud looks like an enormous blob, while the user can zoom in to show all the connections between their data sources.
